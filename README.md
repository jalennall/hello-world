#hello-world

Hello!!
Jalen here, introducing you to my git page. while at the time of making this in September 2019, the account 
is empty. Down the road I hope to have more uploads of projects i've worked on!!

i went to a post malone concert the week before i made this and he had a great quote before his last song

>Do whatever you want because you’re the f'ing "stuff". Live your life. Live your dream. Live your truth. Do everything you want to in. life because you’re the f'ing stuff, and no one can stop you.

had to cut and edit a good amount of it to make it family friendly, but it's a great quote!
